The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps:

1.Download and Extract the Dataset

The UCI HAR Dataset is downloaded and extracted into a folder called UCI_HAR_Dataset.

2.Read the training and the test sets and assign column names

3.Read subject set and assign column

4.Merges the training , test sets and subject set to create one data set.

5.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Keep only columns with name that contains "mean" or "std" in the merged dataset

6.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Replace code with actual activity name in the code column

7.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Change column names to a readable format according to the features_info.txt file in The UCI HAR Dataset

8. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Group by subject and activity and summarize all for mean
Use write.table function to output the table as a txt file
